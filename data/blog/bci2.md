The human brain, a mysterious subject of study in the Universe comprises remarkable information storage and processing systems that possess extraordinary computation efficiency. The study of neuroscience states that the brain has more power as compared to supercomputers like the blue gene(fastest computer in the world) which is having 1,20,000 processors that can process 10 quadrillion bits of information per second.

# Brain-Computer Interface
I believe movement is the most important function of the brain, now if it is so important how well we are doing to understand how the brain controls movements? we can look at how we are doing by thinking about building Machines that can do what humans can do with more efficiency helps us to communicate with devices we can simply say that it provides telepathy communication between your brain and computer with the help of neuro signals which is coming from our brain.

The BCI works by using electrodes implanted in the brain. The electrodes pick up electrical signals from neurons firing in certain areas of the brain and send them to a computer that interprets those signals as commands. For example, if you want to move your hand up or down, then the computer will interpret that as an intention to perform some action with it.

“As a computer intelligence gets better, what will be possible when we interface our brains with computers? it might sound scary, but early evidence suggests otherwise: interfacing brains with machines can help treat traumatic brain injury, repairing spinal cord damage and countless other applications” -Bill Maris.


"At the 2014 Football World Cup in Brazil, a teenager who was paralyzed kicked the first football of the World Cup with the help of BCI controlled exoskeleton system"

Imagine in the future world if we want to send a message, voicemail, or call not with gestures nor with the help of any devices but with our thoughts alone we might simply send them our thoughts describing feelings, emotions, and sensation across the world.
### The future is already here!

## Glimpse of Neurotechnology

Neurotechnology is a diverse field, both deep in complexity and broad in capability. nowadays AI is in boom and Neurotechnology emerges from Both AI and Neuroscience. it applies that what we know about the brain, how it works, and what is consciousness? knowing how the brain works will be very good for building machines that will help in further understanding of the brain and its activities such as curing, brain illnesses even enhancing our thoughtful process of mind that’s what Neuroscience is all about. we can understand neurotechnology as a combination of AI and neuroscience. AI is trying to emulate our perceptual, motor, and cognitive capacities and Neuroscience is trying to make sense of why and how we use those capacities.

“The purpose of neurotechnology is to combine both to create machines that’ll repair and improve our brains and minds in new unimaginable ways"


The medical use of Neurotechnology appears boundless, solving medical problems and limitations to extending natural human capabilities but one day people with certain disabilities like paralysis, brain stroke may have the ability to do things like the average may naturally not be able to do. After this, we can accurately measure the activity of the brain, thought and also send signals back without interference with natural processes we can surely improve the diagnostic efficiency of living entities. The benefits of Neuroscience are clear if the Research is going faster in this domain, then obviously, we have to dramatically improve the Human Race by integrating our Neural matter directly with technology. I believe BCI helps us to do things like that. The new world is ready for communicating with two minds.

# Technical Challenges and Possibilities
The Brain-computer interface has many challenges. One of the most important BCI challenges is to develop a dependable, robust and inexpensive brain-computer interface technology that is suitable for widespread use in the civilian sector and can be used by people having disabilities. Current BCI systems are expensive and require highly trained technical operators. The next generation of BCI systems should be easy to use and cost-effective to become available to a wide range of users.
The primary challenge in BCI research is to identify the neural signals that are associated with specific cognitive activities. In other words, we need to understand how the neural activity generated in our brains when we think about moving a particular body part is different from when we think about moving another body part or when we do not think about anybody’s movement at all. This understanding will enable us to design algorithms that will accurately detect which of these three types of mental states a subject is currently in.
The second challenge is to translate these neural signals into commands for controlling external devices, such as wheelchairs or robotic arms.

The possibilities of BCI are staggering, but currently, their use is limited by accuracy and accessibility. In order to be useful to people in everyday situations, they must be able to perform complex tasks accurately, quickly, and reliably in real-time. In addition, because of their current expense and complexity, only some research labs have access to these devices.
