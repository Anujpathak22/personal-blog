Have you ever wondered what the sky would look like in the radio spectrum?


These white flashes are the fast radio bursts in the sky that you'll be able to see. Although a major part of the sky might look dark, our galactic center will be visible a lot brighter.

But to be able to see in the radio spectrum with the same angular resolution as we have in the visible spectrum, we would need bigger eyes.

## How big?

Well, if you want to see in the hydrogen line band (used to see cold and neutral interstellar hydrogen clouds), you would need eyes with a diameter bigger than 9,000 meters, or your eyes should be bigger than the size of Mount Everest.

Observing various galactic and extragalactic objects at radio wavelengths is very popular among astronomers nowadays. Observing at a radio wavelength can reveal various hidden details about an astronomical object that might not be possible at other wavelengths. Because radio waves can pass through dense gas clouds, they can reveal a lot of hidden information about a source.

Also, radio waves are not affected by atmospheric interference, which means we can take observations in the cloudy sky as well as in the daytime.


## Discovery of the first astronomical radio signal
The very first astronomical radio signal was detected in 1932 by Karl Jansky, who was an American physicist and radio engineer.

Karl Jansky (1905–1950)
He was trying to figure out why there was noisy interference in short-wave radio transatlantic voice communications. He detected a radio signal that he claimed to be coming from somewhere beyond our solar system. He also mentioned that the direction of the signal is the direction in which our solar system is moving.
He later realized that he had detected signals from our galactic center.

He wrote a paper about his discovery in 1933, “Radio Waves from Outside the Solar System” which was the most important paper in astronomy in the 20th century. To honor him and his work, Jansky was declared the unit to measure radio wave intensity (flux density).
His work laid the foundation for Radio Astronomy and inspired many astronomers, like Jocelyn Bell, a young graduate student who discovered pulsars in 1967.

### Now let’s understand the basics of radio waves,
The electromagnetic (EM) spectrum is a range of all possible frequencies of electromagnetic radiation. Electromagnetic radiation includes various types of waves, such as radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays, and gamma rays.


Radio waves have the longest wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum, starting from the size of the tip of our pencil all the way up to the diameter of the earth. They are used for communication, broadcasting, television, cell phones, and wireless networks. Radio waves are also used for radar, which is used in air traffic control, weather forecasting, and military applications.

### Some of the important radio frequency bands used in astronomy include:

Very low frequency (VLF): 3 kHz to 30 kHz
Low frequency (LF): 30 kHz to 300 kHz
Medium frequency (MF): 300 kHz to 3 MHz
High frequency (HF): 3 MHz to 30 MHz
Very high frequency (VHF): 30 MHz to 300 MHz
Ultra high frequency (UHF): 300 MHz to 3 GHz
Microwave: 3 GHz to 300 GHz


Astronomers use radio waves to study objects in the universe that emit or reflect radio waves, such as stars, galaxies, and pulsars. Each frequency band is sensitive to different types of astronomical phenomena. For example, the VLF and LF bands are used to study the Earth’s ionosphere and magnetosphere, the MF band (1,420 MHz precisely) is used to see hydrogen clouds in the interstellar medium, and the UHF and microwave bands are used to observe extragalactic objects like quasars and active galaxies.

## But why do astronomical objects emit radio waves?
Actually, all objects emit radiation at all wavelengths. Even our bodies can emit radio to gamma radiation, but the intensity varies with temperature. The radiation emitted by any body or system that can absorb all the incident radiation is called Black Body Radiation.


Although there is no ideal black body, we can compare the properties of a black body with other bodies.

Colder objects emit waves with very low frequencies (such as radio or microwaves), while hot objects emit visible light or even ultraviolet and higher frequencies.

Due to black body radiation, all the astronomical sources emit some of their radiation in the radio spectrum like radio galaxies, quasars and some nebulas. However, a pulsar emits radio waves due to the relative rotation speed of the pulsar and its magnetic field.

## Radio Telescope
We can’t see these radio sources using our optical telescopes, we would need some special telescopes and detectors (feed) to see these radio sources. Astronomers use radio telescopes to see these radio sources. To understand these radio telescopes let’s first understand how an optical telescope works,


This is a Catadioptric Telescope, it uses mirrors and lenses to reflect light into the detector (like a CCD camera or human eye). The large primary mirror collects the incoming visible radiation and reflects it toward the detector using a secondary mirror.


A radio telescope works on a similar concept, it contains a primary dish to collect incoming radio signals, and it contains a feed or detector at the focus of the dish. Some antenna dish designs have a feed in the middle of the dish and a secondary reflector at the focus to reflect radiation at the center into the feed. Since the astronomical sources are located at infinity (because aperture of dish <<<< source distance) the rays get reflected by the primary dish and get collected into the feed at the focus.

These single dish radio telescopes cannot provide decent angular resolution. According to the formula for angular resolution,


When the diameter stays the same but the wavelength increases, the angular resolution increases, which is not good for large objects like galaxies. So to attain the same angular resolution with radio as with optical, we need to increase the size of the primary dish.

To get good angular resolution with optical telescopes, we don’t need a large aperture size. Aperture size of 1 meter can provide an angular resolution of 0.014 seconds. To get the same angular resolution, we need a 3.7 km aperture for radio at a 21 cm wavelength.

The largest single dish radio telescope is Tianyan, or the Eye of Heaven, FAST situated in a karst depression in Pingtang, Guizhou province in southwest China. Its total size is 500 meters with an aperture of 300 meters, which has an angular resolution of 2.9 arcmin at the 21 cm wavelength.

Radio Interferometry
But there is a clever way to achieve low angular resolution without building large aperture antennas, which is Radio Interferometry.

We don’t have to use a single large antenna. Instead, we can use many small antennas to create a virtual large antenna. To understand the working of the radio interferometer, let’s take 2 antennas.


The incoming radiation falls on the antenna at different times due to the path difference the radiation had to take for the other antenna. Here, antenna 1 will receive the radiation first, and after some time, antenna 2 will receive the radiation. Because of this difference in the path, the signals received by the antennas will be out of phase, so signals from antenna 1 will have a time delay before they are correlated with the signals from antenna 2. When the signals are in phase, they are passed through a correlator to determine their visibility. This process is repeated for every pair of antennas in the array. By increasing the baseline (distance between pair of antennas), it is possible to achieve a very small angular resolution.

Some of the best radio telescopes use interferometry to achieve low angular resolution, like the Very Large Array (VLA) in San Agustin, New Mexico, which was developed by the NRAO (National Radio Astronomy Observatory). It consists of 28 dishes with an aperture of 25 meters, operating at frequencies ranging from 1 GHz to 50 GHz. It has an angular resolution of 0.2 to 0.04 arcseconds.


Very Large Array (VLA)
However, the VLBA (Very Large Baseline Array) Telescope has the lowest angular resolution of any telescope, with a resolution of 0.001 arcseconds, which is even less than the Hubble Telescope’s resolution of 0.04 arcseconds.
